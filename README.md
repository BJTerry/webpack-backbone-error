# webpack-backbone-error

This project demonstrates my inability to get webpack working with react-widgets.

1. clone project.
2. bower install
3. npm install
4. webpack
5. Try to open the html file in the browser and observe the following error:

> TypeError: n is undefined

> ...t,s){"use strict";{var n=s(12),r=s(15),i=n.version.split(".").map(parseFloat);e....

> bundle.js (line 73, col 20777)

Or perhaps the error:

> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'version' of undefined

> bundle.js:73
